 * tgDataObserverBasic is a type of tgDataLogger, which observes a model.
 * When notified, this observer calls individual data loggers for different
 * Loggable type objects inside the model.
 * This basic data observer only logs the center-of-mass of rods.
 * Note that there should never be model-specific information in any of these
 * data observer or logger classes.
 * Also note that unlike the original tgDataObserver class, this one is
 * actually a real tgObserver!
